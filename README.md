# ~~FactionsUUID~~

**WARNING**: This repo is <u><i>NOT</i></u> the official factions repo.

It is an internal fork, not used (or updated) in years.

### The current **official repo** is [@drtshock/Factions](https://github.com/drtshock/Factions).

Please go there.

You may have wound up here from google search. This is a mistake. I was never a primary developer of factions, I was only a contributor for a short time.

I still get some emails about this, especially asking for a free copy. This was allowed for small and non-profit servers. AFAIK, that policy is still in place, but you should *not ask here*. 

If you have any issues, or questions, or just anything, please go to the **official repo** at [@drtshock/Factions](https://github.com/drtshock/Factions).

Last I checked, the spigot page is [https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsuuid.1035/](here) and the maintainer was [https://github.com/mbaxter](@mbaxter). This may change over time, so you should verify this.

In the future, this repo may be deleted or made private. Don't rely on its existence.
